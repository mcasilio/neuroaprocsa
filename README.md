# Hello and welcome to the neuroaprocsa repository!

last updated: 4/26/2024

This is a repository for materials supporting the neuroaprocsa project, which focuses on the brain basis of naturalistic language production in aphasia using auditory-perceptual rating of connected speech in aphasia (APROCSA; Casilio et al., 2019). This repository is currently archived as a means of sharing the files with the public in a read-only format. However, it is still actively maintained. Any questions concerning the analyses or code can be sent to: marianne.e.casilio@vanderbilt.edu.

# Data and code

The following two zip files contain data and code for reproducing analyses in a submitted manuscript, 'Four dimensions of naturalistic language production in aphasia after stroke':

neuroaprocsa_datasharing_matlab.zip

neuroaprocsa_datasharing_R.zip

Each zip file contains relevant data files and code for running the analyses, either using custom scripts or freely available packages. Code was written for use in MATLAB 2019a for Linux OS and R 4.3.0 for Mac OS. Users will need to specify a working directory and ensure the data files/scripts are in said directory prior to running the code.

# Score calculator

We have created a calculator that automatically generates scores on APROCSA's four dimensions, which are described in a submitted manuscript, 'Four dimensions of naturalistic language production in aphasia after stroke.' This calculator is available at https://redcap.link/aprocsa.

# Training materials

We completed a related study that describes the development of a clinical training program for APROCSA. The manual we developed for this program is provided as part of this repository:

APROCSA_manual.pdf

The entirety of the materials (e.g., training webinar with video examples) will be shared at a future date. Intermin results will be presented at the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association Convention this upcoming November, details for which can be found at https://plan.core-apps.com/asha2023/event/83c9e54e7c0ab1d9072aee98566950dc.

For those who would like to practice rating APROCSA with reference to expert consensus scores, we curated a freely shareable dataset of audiovisual-recorded naturalistic language samples. This dataset is available on our lab website at https://aphasialab.org/aprocsa-dataset/ and on AphasiaBank (MacWhinney et al., 2011) at https://aphasia.talkbank.org/access/English/Aphasia/APROCSA-access/APROCSA.html. Our paper in Data (Ezzes et al., 2022) describing this work is available at https://aphasialab.org/publications/.

# Additional resources

The original manuscript and other materials on APROCSA are available at http://langneurosci.org/aprocsa. An interactive website on our larger dataset, which details recovery from aphasia after stroke more generally, will be available at a future date at http://langneurosci.org/recovery/portal.
